        Welcome to the CSS Display lecture! In this lecture, we will explore the different display properties in CSS and how they affect the layout of elements on a webpage.
    </div>

    <div>
        The `display` property in CSS is used to control the layout of elements. It can take several values, including `block`, `inline`, `inline-block`, `flex`, and `grid`. Each value has its own unique behavior and use cases.
    </div>

    <span>
        The `block` value makes an element a block-level element, meaning it takes up the full width available and starts on a new line.
    </span>

    <span>
        The `inline` value makes an element an inline-level element, meaning it only takes up as much width as necessary and does not start on a new line.
    </span>
</body>
